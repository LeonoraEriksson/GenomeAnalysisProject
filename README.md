# GenomeAnalysisProject
This repository is for the project in the Genome Analysis course.
I am working with the analysis from paper 4, "The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)" https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3972.
The project aims to create a draft genome assembly of D.zibethinus scaffold 10 created from the study in the article. Further goals are to do strucural and functional annotation of the scaffold, as well as a differential expression analysis comparing the expression of genes in different organs of D.zibethinus.
